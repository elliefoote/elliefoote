<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Ellie</h1>

- 🦘 I've just moved back to Sydney, Australia, after 6 years living in 💃 Spain.
- 🌱 My most recent role was working as a full-stack Software Engineer at Eventbrite, using Typescript and Python. I also love learning new things, and I can rapidly ramp up to be productive in an unfamiliar language - I had never used Python before joining Eventbrite!
