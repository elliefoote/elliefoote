- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ellie. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a software engineer and lifelong learner. I discovered the fun of coding during the pandemic and haven't looked back! I love the satisfaction that comes with debugging a tricky coding problem, and it is so exciting to see my projects come to life.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning GatsbyJS and studying up on data structures and algorithms.
